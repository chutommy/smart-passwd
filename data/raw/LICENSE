+++ ENABLE2K word lists +++

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally
  released into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or
  distribute it in any manner they see fit. No fee or registration
  is required for its use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you
  feel you absolutely must contribute something for your own peace
  of mind, the authors of the ENABLE list ask that you make a
  donation on their behalf to your favorite charity). This word
  list is our gift to the Scrabble community, as an alternate to
  "official" word lists. Game designers may feel free to
  incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please mention the
  source and credit us as originators of the list. Note that if
  you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product, you
  may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict
  your rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only
  fair.
